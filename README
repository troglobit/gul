Description
===========

A first attempt at writing an editor.
First steps made in HP_UX 10.20 on a Windows NT 4.0 Workstation using
E... and XDM-login on one of the HP PA-RISC servers at work.

Development continued at home in Red Hat GNU/Linux on a simple old
PentiumOverdrive wich later got upgraded into a Cyrix 6x86 166 MHz.
Which in turn now only works as server to the Laptop PII @300MHz.
Still Red Hat though ...

Parallell testing done in Solaris at the student body, SdU, using a
wide range of Sun SPARC IPX's SparcStation 2, SPARC 10's. Testing
have also begun on our SparcStation ELC's.


General information
===================

The documentation/specification is now rewritten in LaTeX. For a short
introductory to LaTeX, see Dr. Posts' homepage under 'Courses':
	http://www.idt.mdh.se/personal/kpt/

"LaTeX is the lingua franca among scientists."
"Based on TeX written by Donald Knuth."
"Difficult to learn but very powerful."
"When pronouncing LaTeX your screen is supposed to get real wet..."

                                          -- dr. K. Post

It's also the GNU projects preferred typesetting/documentation tool and
it really isn't that difficult to learn if you've ever written HTML/XML/SGML.


Installation
============

See the file INSTALL.


Running
=======

The editor runs best in a TERM=linux environment but have also been
tested in xterm-windows. The only keys working as of 1999-03-27 is
cursor-keys and delete. Everything else is pretty much untested.
Added:
	native vt100 interface.
	slang support.
	new editor core based on buffer-gap.


Bugs
====

Plenty. Do something about it! :P
A trace is written to stderr. Redirect the trace to a file 
when running gul. (gul filename 2>logfile) see the source
for more info, as usual.
