Some small tips when testing in different environments:

	* When delete/backspace doesn't seem to work, try Ctrl-H ...

	* If the display looks awful #1, take a look at display.c. Mainly
	it's the statusbar, displayStatus(), that gets malplaced. 

	* If the display looks awful #2, take a loog at the current
	editor core. The functions for moving the virtual screen are
	quite messed up.

	* In gulMain.c there's a DEBUG-define that can be used to send
	debug-messages to stderr. When set to zero stderr is redirected
	to /dev/null.

	* make clean first if nothing seems to work. ;)
