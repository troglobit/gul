   This is a copy of a document which has been knocking around for many
   years now, explaining how to drive a VT100 terminal. There are other
   ways to go about this, notably programing with curses, but this is the
   grass-roots level of working.

Subj:   Escape codes

        In a .COM file use:

                ESC[0,8]=%X1B

        to define the escape character. When an escape sequence is required use
:

                WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "''ESC'..."

        In a text file use the following twice to put the escape character into
a text file:

                CTRL/[      -       on VT200
                ESC         -       on VT100.

        The escape sequences are as follows:
