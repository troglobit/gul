* Outstanding items

* Bad stuff happen when the gap is exhausted.
The current handling of when we run out of space in the gap
is bad.  Nasty shit happen and we really don't care that
mcuh currently.

Do it right.

* The display-routines MUST be fixed. 
As of now the file cannot be wider or longer than the screen. Any
editing outside of that is impossible. It is a scary hack right now...

* Freshen up the LaTeX documentation ...

* Generalize event handling.
Replace keyboardPluginCheckForInput() with gul_event() or similar.

* Make out how to deal with specific SIGNALS!
What are we supposed to do with SIGINT or SIGHUP and others??
What about other platforms?

* Create the newFile () functions
... as of now only readFile () and saveFile () functions exist. We
need more primitives! We also need to make out who owns what and
belongs to whom? 

File I/O is supposed to be done by a ... you guessed it ... a plugin.
Providing just as much needed by the current editor core. Remember
that VMS has some kind of virtual pages that can be used here - in
the VMS plugin that is.

How do we open a file?
	- read only, r/w?
	- binary/text?
Make as much possible to open and edit binary files, investigate
the possible loss of doing so - is it more complicated?
   	
* Testing ... :P
A lot of stupid combindations need to be tried out. E.g. vt100
and yaei, slang and original, etc. Silly configure script options.

* Internationalization (i18n) issues. 

** Gettext for error and status messages.
** Unicode support via a library.
Look at both Raph Levien (www.levien.com) and that redhat dude's
stuff (Pango.org). They have recently proposed an API merge to create
a free stand-alone library.
