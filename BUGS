Known bugs in the current version of Gul:

2000-01-12 yaei - the first buffer-gap core:

	* Pretty stable!

	* Rendering to screen does not work beyond the first screen. No
	  page up, horisontal scrolling or anything that nice. :(


1999-04-05 original editor core:

	* The cursor sometimes gets a bit lost. Gets ahead or behind one row.

	* When moving around a lot AND deleting, gul sometimes segfaults.

	* Only works "OK" in a Linux console.
